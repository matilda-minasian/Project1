                preserved their unique identity, traditions, language and customs through centuries of challenges, changes, 
                and despite living in many different parts of the world.
            </p>

            <h2>Eastern and Western Armenia</h2>
            <p>
                Armenians are divided into two main historic groups: Eastern and Western Armenians.
                This difference is based on the geographic location of their ancestors, with Eastern Armenians 
                primarily residing in the Republic of Armenia and Western Armenians historically living in the Ottoman Empire.
                 Despite this division, both groups share culture and heritage that unites them as a people.        
            </p>

            <h3>Western Armenia</h3>
            <p>
                Western Armenians lived primarily in the Ottoman Empire, which is modern day eastern Turkey. Today many Western Armenians 
                live in the global Armenian diaspora, particularly in countries like the United States, Lebonan, Syria, Iraq, and France.
            </p>

            <h3>Eastern Armenia</h3>
            <p>
                Eastern Armenians have historically lived in the Republic of Armenia, which is located in the South Caucasus region. 
                This area has been home to Armenians for thousands of years and is considered the heartland of Armenian culture and identity.
                Many Eastern Armenians also live in the global Armenian diaspora, particularly in Russia, Iran, and the United States.
            </p>

            <h3>Language Differences</h3>
            <p>
                The Armenian language has two main dialects: Western Armenian and Eastern Armenian. 
                While both dialects are mutually intelligible, they have some differences in pronunciation, vocabulary, spelling, and grammar. 
                While there are many people that still speak both dialects, Western Armenian is considered an endangered language, with
                fewer speakers than Eastern Armenian.
            </p>

            <h3>Shared identity</h3>
            <p>
                Despite the differences between Western and Eastern Armenians, both groups share a common culture, history, and identity. 
                They are united by their cultural roots, alphabet, religious traditions, and historical heritage. Both groups have contributed significantly
                to Armenian culture and history, and continue to do so today, both in Armenia and in the global Armenian diaspora, where they
                maintain strong connections to their homeland by spearheading cultural events, language preservation efforts, and community organizations that
                promote cultural food, music, dance, religion, family traditions, and more.
