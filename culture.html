            <h2>Mount Ararat</h2>
            <p>
                Mount Ararat is one of the most important national symbols of Armenia. Although the mountain is located in modern-day Turkey, it has
                always held a strong cultural and historical connection to the Armenian people. 
            </p>

            <p>
                According to biblical tradition, Mount Ararat is believed to be the resting place of Noah's Ark after the great flood. Because of this,
                the mountain has both religious and national meaning.
            </p>

            <p>
                Today, Mount Ararat appears on Armenia's national coat of arms and isvisible from the capital city of Yerevan on clear days.
